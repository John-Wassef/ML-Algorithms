## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful tool used to uncover patterns and make predictions from data. This repository demonstrates several machine learning techniques applied to different datasets to solve real-world problems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for classification tasks.
- `clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for clustering tasks.
- `regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for regression tasks.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the notebooks.

## Datasets

The following datasets are included in the `data/` directory:

- `Pizza-Price.csv`: Dataset containing pizza prices.
- `Second Wizard War DeadorAliveUpdated.csv`: Dataset related to a fictional scenario.
- `battles.csv`: Dataset of battle statistics.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/John-Wassef/ML-Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ML-Algorithms
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open and run the desired notebook.
